<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>550g plain flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>400g golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>250g light brown sugar</li>
    <li>500ml sunflower oil</li>
    <li>500g carrots, peeled and grated</li>
    <li>100g nuts (such as pistachios, pecans or walnuts), chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>STEP 1

        Prepare the dry ingredients

Preheat the oven to gas 5, 190°C, fan 170°C. Grease and line 3 x 23cm sandwich cake tins (if you only have 1-2 tins, you can cook the cakes in batches). Mix together 550g plain flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda, 2 tsp ground cinnamon, ½ tsp nutmeg (freshly grated or ground) and ½ tsp salt in a large bowl. </li>
    <li>STEP 2

        Mix with the wet ingredients

In a separate bowl, add 400g golden caster sugar, 250g light-brown sugar and 6 large eggs, then whisk together to combine. Gradually pour in 500ml sunflower oil, whisking until fully combined. Stir in 500g carrots, peeled and grated and 50g chopped nuts (such as pistachios, walnuts or pecans). Add to the flour mixture in 3 stages, folding gently with a large spoon until the mixture is just combined. </li>
    <li>STEP 3

        Bake

Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake for 35-40 mins until golden, well risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Allow to cool for 10 mins in the tins before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely. If cooking in batches, cook the first cakes then wash and dry the tins and repeat for the 3 layers.</li>
    <li>STEP 4

        Decorate and serve

Sprinkle the top of the cake with another 50g chopped nuts (pistachios, walnuts or pecans). Slice to serve, or store in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
