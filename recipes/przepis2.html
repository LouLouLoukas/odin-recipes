    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a>Make your own version of this takeaway favourite, complete with chilli and garlic sauces. Serve your homemade doner kebab with pitta bread and shredded cabbage</a>
</body>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 tsp crushed chillies</li>
    <li>2 tsp turmeric</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>8cm piece ginger</li>
    <li>300g yellow split peas</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil (or vegetable oil)</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the spices

        Put a small frying pan over a medium heat and add 2 tsp cumin seeds. Shake in the pan for 1-2 mins until fragrant and just lightly toasted. Set aside to cool slightly. Measure out 1 tsp crushed chillies and 2 tsp turmeric and mix with the cumin seeds. Peel 3 garlic cloves and an 8cm piece ginger. Finely chop the garlic and cut the ginger into 4 chunky pieces.</li>
    <li>Start the peas

        Put 300g yellow split peas in a large lidded pan or flameproof casserole dish and cover with 1.3ltr cold water. Bring to a simmer over a medium-high heat. If any foam rises to the top of the liquid, skim this off with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Add flavour

        Once at a simmer, reduce the heat to low. Stir in the spices, garlic and ginger, cover with a lid and simmer gently for 1 hr.</li>
    <li>Cook the dhal

        Remove the lid and stir gently. Cook for another 20 mins without the lid to allow the split peas to become fully tender. At this point the dhal should be thick and creamy but can be loosened with a splash of water if preferred â€“ for example, if serving as a soup rather than a side dish or curry main.</li>
